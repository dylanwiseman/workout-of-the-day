# Dylan's Workout of the Day
I'm no personal trainer, but I love fitness. Follow along with the workouts I do each day of the week. 

#### Today's Workout:
The "Today's Workout" button will return a list of exercises taken from 2 or more workout types, based on the day of the week. Click on the name of each workout to cross if off and click again to un-cross it. 

#### Workouts by Type:
Underneath the "Today's Workout" button, you can click on a specific workout type to see the exercises I like for that muscle group. Workouts that I or my friends created are styled in gold. 

#### Styling:
Styling was based on the [Angled Gradient Button from CSS Lab](https://csslab.app/buttons/angled-gradient-button)
